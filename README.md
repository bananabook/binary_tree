## What is this?
This is an implementation of a binary tree. It is written in c++ and commented.

## How to run it.
You need the g++ Gnu compiler. You can compile the source code directly or if you have make installed you can just run 'make' to use the Makefile.

## Why run it?
It has a nice print function:

```

│││└0
│││ ├0
│││ │├1
│││ │└nullptr
│││ └nullptr
││└nullptr

└nullptr
```
